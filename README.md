# Rebalanced Moons BETA

This mod uses LethalLevelLoader to update some of the vanilla moons to hopefully create a more streamlined progression experience and rebalance some moons that we considered unfit normally. Offense, March, and Dine have been reworked, with minor adjustments to other moons such as Assurance and Titan. This is currently very early in development and many things are subject to change. 

# List of changes
- Offense now has an alternate, but long route that you can take to get to fire exit. There's a new silo on the map that marks where you need to go.
- Offense and assurance have swapped loot pools (with manual tweaks), and offense on average should be around ~900 value with assurance averaging at around ~500.
- Offense's Coilhead spawn chance was slightly reduced.
- Offense's power level was decreased to 10.
- Slightly lowered spawn rate of halves on Offense.
- March's left fire exit was moved to the right of the ship to create a more evenly distanced triangle of fire exits around the moon. It's also a slightly shorter walk.
- March now has a water tower hinting at the back fire exit's location.
- March can now spawn other vanilla interiors by default.
- March's facility size was decreased to 1.75.
- Titan can now spawn gold bars.
- Titan's facility size was decreased to 2.
- Titan's spawn curve was adjusted to be a bit more forgiving.
- Titan now has 3 fire exits.
- Dine now has two fire exits, one requiring an extension ladder or a jetpack
- Dine's terrain was slightly edited to allow for an alternate route from the right fire exit.
- Dine now has guide light poles that go towards main, and the fence in the middle of the map was moved back so the moon is more cruiser friendly.
- Dine and Rend swapped loot tables.
- Butler chances significantly reduced on Dine.
- Embrion now has equal spawn rates for every single one handed scrap item in the game. Let's go gambling.
- Vain Shrouds can no longer spawn on Titan or Embrion.
- Adamance's layout has been edited to be more Cruiser friendly.
- Masked now spawn on Dine and have a small chance to spawn on Offense.
