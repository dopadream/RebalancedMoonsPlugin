# Rebalanced Moons BETA

This mod updates some of the vanilla moons and reimplements every level using optimized LethalLevelLoader scenes. There are various subjective changes to moons to hopefully make them more interesting and fun to play on. ButteRyBalance is heavily recommended as it now handles the intended stats for this mod.

# List of changes
- Offense now has an alternate, but long route that you can take to get to fire exit. There's a new silo on the map that marks where you need to go.
- March's left fire exit was moved to the right of the ship to create a more evenly distanced triangle of fire exits around the moon. It's also a slightly shorter walk.
- March now has a water tower hinting at the back fire exit's location.
- Don't cross the rickety bridge on March.. You'll get lost!
- March can now spawn other vanilla interiors by default.
- Titan can now spawn gold bars.
- Titan now has 2 fire exits (with an optional 3rd one).
- Dine now has two fire exits, one requiring an extension ladder or a jetpack
- Dine's terrain was slightly edited to allow for an alternate route from the right fire exit.
- Dine now has guide light poles that go towards main, and the fence in the middle of the map was moved back so the moon is more cruiser friendly.
- Embrion now has equal spawn rates for every single one handed scrap item in the game. Let's go gambling.
- Embrion generates giant boulders across the map for more stealthy routes around Old Birds.
- Vain Shrouds can no longer spawn on Titan or Embrion.
- Adamance's layout has been edited to be more Cruiser friendly.
