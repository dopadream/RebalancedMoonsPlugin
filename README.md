# Rebalanced Moons BETA

This mod updates some of the vanilla moons, utilizing LethalLevelLoader to replace some, and adjusting the stats of others. The goal is to make the game have a more streamlined progression experience and make some of the more underwhelming moons more fun to route to.

# List of changes
- Offense now has an alternate, but long route that you can take to get to fire exit. There's a new silo on the map that marks where you need to go.
- Offense and assurance have swapped loot pools (with manual tweaks), and offense on average should be around ~900 value with assurance averaging at around ~500.
- Offense's Coilhead spawn chance was slightly reduced.
- Offense's power level was decreased to 10.
- Slightly lowered spawn rate of halves on Offense.
- March's left fire exit was moved to the right of the ship to create a more evenly distanced triangle of fire exits around the moon. It's also a slightly shorter walk.
- March now has a water tower hinting at the back fire exit's location.
- Don't cross the rickety bridge on March.. You'll get lost!
- March can now spawn other vanilla interiors by default.
- March's facility size was decreased to 1.8.
- Titan can now spawn gold bars.
- Titan's facility size was decreased to 2 (but also has less traps to compensate)
- Titan's spawn curve was adjusted to be a bit more forgiving.
- Titan now has 2 fire exits (with an optional 3rd one).
- Dine now has two fire exits, one requiring an extension ladder or a jetpack
- Dine's terrain was slightly edited to allow for an alternate route from the right fire exit.
- Dine now has guide light poles that go towards main, and the fence in the middle of the map was moved back so the moon is more cruiser friendly.
- Dine and Rend swapped loot tables.
- Butler chances significantly reduced on Dine.
- Embrion now has equal spawn rates for every single one handed scrap item in the game. Let's go gambling.
- Vain Shrouds can no longer spawn on Titan or Embrion.
- Adamance's layout has been edited to be more Cruiser friendly.
- Masked now spawn on Dine and have a small chance to spawn on Offense.
